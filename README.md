# New Opn Legacy

 - This project's main purpose is to bring simple performance to OpenGl Legacy and a minimalist and practical code model.

- you can make any design with it

## How it works

 - The project works from a model predefined by me where in this model it runs ***glfw3*** and together with it ***glou2*** and ***opengl32***, from that it creates its own compiler and does its own debug, thus generating a new script with its new performance

## Libs

| opengl32 |glfw3  |
|--|--|
| glou2 |hscYU4  |


|ImportVersel| gr.mmo|
|--|--|
| gr. gl | opglfw.l |

## How to make it work

 - install
 
 


    
    
 

       Mgw
        
       Mlwg

       glfw3
 

 - Then put it in the import properties of your project
 
 - done that it will be ready for that but remember to leave the compiler in 32 bit and in debug local()
